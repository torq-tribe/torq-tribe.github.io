      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Torq Tribe</strong> (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and shares
        information when you use our mobile app and related services (the “Service”).
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Fitness/Health Disclaimer (Important):</strong>
        <p style="margin:8px 0 0;">
          Torq Tribe provides general fitness and educational information only. It is <strong>not</strong> medical advice and is not a substitute for professional guidance.
          Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new fitness program. Stop immediately if you experience pain, dizziness, faintness, chest pain,
          or shortness of breath, and seek medical attention as appropriate. In an emergency, call your local emergency number.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1) Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information in three main ways: (a) information you provide, (b) information generated by your use of the Service, and (c) information from third parties you choose to connect.</p>

      <h2>1A) Information you provide</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> When you create an account or sign in, we use Supabase Auth to authenticate you (e.g., email and authentication identifiers/tokens managed by Supabase Auth).</li>
        <li><strong>Onboarding & profile data:</strong> You can provide profile details used to personalize your plan, such as name, gender, age, height, weight, estimated/provided body fat percentage, strength experience, body type, fitness goal and timeframe, session length, sessions per week, activity level, available equipment, workout style, followed influencers, favorite exercises, injuries, nutrition preference, daily calorie intake, and optional estimated 1RM lifts (e.g., squat/deadlift/bench/OHP).:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
        <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> If you contact us, we receive the information you include in your message.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1B) Information generated by your use of the Service</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Workout plans and progress:</strong> The Service generates and retrieves your workout plan from the backend and may store workout completion history. Your workout plan is generated and fetched via Supabase-backed services.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
        <li><strong>Local app data (on-device):</strong> To improve performance and reliability, the app may cache certain data locally (for example, workout history cached in device storage such as UserDefaults).:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
        <li><strong>Basic technical data:</strong> Like most online services, our infrastructure providers may process basic log data (e.g., IP address, timestamps, request metadata) for security and operational purposes. We do not use this to try to identify you beyond providing and securing the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1C) Third-party connections (future)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Health (planned):</strong> We intend to add Apple Health integration later. If enabled, you will choose whether to allow Torq Tribe to read and/or write specific Health data. We will update this policy before shipping that feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics (planned):</strong> We intend to add analytics later to understand app performance and improve user experience. We will update this policy before enabling analytics, including what data is collected and how to opt out (if applicable).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the Service (create accounts, authenticate users, store profiles, generate and deliver workout plans, and save workout progress).</li>
        <li>Personalize your experience based on the information you provide (e.g., goals, equipment, preferences, injuries).</li>
        <li>Maintain safety, security, and integrity of the Service (fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and system monitoring).</li>
        <li>Communicate with you (support requests, important updates, and policy changes).</li>
        <li>Improve the Service (bug fixes, performance improvements; and, in the future, analytics if enabled).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) How we share your information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share information only as needed to operate the Service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We use Supabase as our backend provider for authentication and database storage. Your profile and workout-related data is stored and processed through this infrastructure.:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
        <li><strong>Content links:</strong> The app may display links to third-party content (e.g., YouTube tutorial links). If you open a third-party link, your activity is governed by that third party’s policies (not ours).:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</li>
        <li><strong>Legal/safety:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, or to protect rights, safety, and security (e.g., responding to valid legal requests).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your information for as long as needed to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes,
        and enforce agreements. Some data may remain in backups for a limited period after deletion.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Your choices and rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access/updates:</strong> You may update certain profile information within the app where available.</li>
        <li><strong>Account deletion:</strong> To request deletion of your account and associated data, email us at <a href="mailto:torqtribe@icloud.com">torqtribe@icloud.com</a> from the email address associated with your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Device controls:</strong> You can delete the app to remove locally cached data from your device. Note: server-stored data may still exist until you request account deletion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect your information.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Torq Tribe is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
      </p>

      <h2>8) International processing</h2>
      <p>
        Your information may be processed by our service providers in countries other than where you live, depending on your configuration and infrastructure locations.
        These countries may have different data protection laws.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here and update the effective date above.
        Material changes may also be communicated in-app where appropriate.
      </p>
